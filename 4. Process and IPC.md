[TOC]

## Process

### Process

A **process** is a program in execution. It is composed of three things:

1. The instructions and data of the program (the compiled executable). 
2. The current state of the program.
3. Any resources that are needed to execute the program.

Having two instances of the same program running counts as two separate processes.

### Process Control Block (PCB)

PCB is the OS’s data structure for managing processes

- **Identifier (PID).** A unique ID associated with the process; usually a simple integer that increments when a new process is created and reset when the system is rebooted.
- **State.** The current state of the process.
- **Priority.** How important this process is (compared to the others).
- **Program Counter.** A place to store the address of the next instruction to be executed (*when needed).
- **Register Data.** A place to store the current values of the registers (*when needed); also called context data.
- **Memory Pointers.** Pointers to the code as well as data associated with this process, and any memory that the OS has allocated by request.
- **I/O Status Information.** Any outstanding requests, files, or I/O devices currently assigned to this process.
- **Accounting Information.** Some data about this process’s use of resources. This is optional (but common).

***When needed**: When the program is running, these values do not need to be updated. However, when a system call (trap) or process switch occurs, they will be updated

### Process Family Tree In Unix

- all processes are respresented as a tree structure, where 
  - each node is a process, 
  - each node may have zero or more children 
- In UNIX, when a parent process spawns a child, it can get the code that process returns. 
  - 0:  success
  - other values: an error of some sort. 
- **init**: the first process created and the parent of all processes 
- **process group**: formed by a process and all its descendants
  - certain operations, like sending a signal (e.g., the terminate signal Ctrl-C), can be sent to the whole group, letting each process decide what to do with it.
- **Zombie**: When a child process terminates, but waiting for parent comes by to collect the return value
  - There is still an entry in the PCB list. 
  - And the process still holds on to its allocated resources.
- **Orphan**: If a child process’s parent should die before the child does, and will automatically adopted by the `init` process. 

### Seven State Model

1. **Running:** Actively executing right now.
2. **Ready:** Not running, but ready to execute if selected by the scheduler.
3. **Blocked:** Not running, and not able to run until some event happens.
   1. e.g. wait for user input
4. **New:** Just created but not yet added to the list of processes ready to run.
   1. typically not in memory, but on disk instead [Sta14].
   2. The OS has created the process but has not committed itself to execution thereof.
5. **Terminated:** Finished executing, but not yet cleaned up (reaped).
   1. zombie
6. **Ready/Swapped**: ready to run, and currently not in memory
   - what if all processes are ready but there is not enough memory space? Or, in other words, what if we need to swap out a process that is ready
7. **Blocked/Swapped**: not ready to run, and currently not in memory
   - what if the event the blocked process was awaiting has taken place (e.g., the user presses a key) and the process could proceed

![page7image51417776.png](/Users/shuyi/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/page7image51417776.png)  

There are now eight transitions, most of which are similar to what we have seen before:

- **Create:** The process is created and enters the New state.
- **Admit:** A process in the New state is added to the list of processes ready to start, in the Ready state.
- **Dispatch:** A process that is not currently running begins executing and moves to the Running state.
- **Suspend:** A running program pauses execution, but can still run if allowed, and moves to the Ready state.
- **Exit:** A running program finishes and moves to the Terminated state; its return value is available.
- **Block:** A running program requests a resource, does not get it right away, and cannot proceed.
- **Unblock:** A program, currently blocked, receives the resource it was waiting for; it moves to the Ready state.
- **Reap:** A terminated program’s return value is collected by a wait and its resources can be released.
- **Swap In**: a process being loaded into main memory
- **Swap Out**: a process being written out to disk

### Spawn a Child

#### fork()

`fork()` creates a new process by duplicating the calling process (a copy of self)

- The new process is referred to as the child process.  
- The calling process is referred to as the parent process.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
pid_t fork(void);
```

- return: 
  - pid_t: process id of a process
  - negative: fail
  - 0: current process is a child
  - positive: the process ID of the child

#### wait()

`wait()` suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
pid_t wait(int *wstatus);
```

#### example: how to use fork()

```c
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <unistd.h>

int main( int argc, char** argv ) { 
	pid_t pid;
	int childStatus;
  
  /* fork a child process */
	pid = fork();
  
	if (pid < 0) {
		/* error occurred */ 
    fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed"); 
    return 1;
	} 
  
  else if (pid == 0) { 
    /* child process */
    execlp("/bin/ls","ls",NULL);
	} 
  
  else {
		/* parent process */
		/* parent will wait for the child to complete */
    wait(&childStatus);
		printf("Child Complete with status: %i \n", childStatus);
	}
	return 0; 
}
```

#### example: Fork() Design Solution 

There is a task that can be split into parts ’A’ and ’B’. You may assume there are implementations for the functionsint execute_A() and int execute_B() that work correctly (and are not shown). If either of the execution functions returns a non-zero value, this indicates an error.

Use fork() to create a child process. The child process should call function execute_B() and return the result to the parent. The parent process should call execute_A() and collect its result. The parent should then collect the result of the child using wait() and then produce the console output described in the next paragraph. If no errors occurred, main should return 0; otherwise it should return -1.

If an error occurs, it should be reported to the console including the error number (e.g., “Error 7 Occurred.”). If more than one error occurs, report both errors. If both functions return zero, it means all is well and the program should print “Completed.” to the console.

```c
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
	pid_t pid;
	int child_result; 
  int parent_result;
  
	pid = fork();
  if ( pid < 0 ) { 
    /* Fork Failed */ 
    return -1;
  } else if ( pid == 0 ) { 
    /* Child */ 
    return execute_B();
  } else { 
    /* Parent */ 
    parent_result = execute_A(); 
    wait( &child_result );
  }
  
  if ( child_result == 0 && parent_result == 0 ) { 
    printf( "Completed.\n" );
    return 0;
  }
  if ( child_result != 0 ) {
    printf( "Error %d Occurred.\n", child_result);
  }
  if ( parent_result != 0 ) {
    printf( "Error %d Occurred.\n", parent_result);
  }
	return -1; 
}
```

## IPC

### IPC

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: When two or more processes would like to co-ordinate or exchange data the mechanism for doing so

**communication**: transfer of data from one process to another. 

**message**: the data being transferred

- The processes involved must have some agreement on: 
  - What data a message should contain; and
  - The way the data is formatted, e.g. XML

**sender**: the process sending that message

**receiver**: the process receiving the message

Sending and receiving of messages may be either synchronous or asynchronous. 

1. **Synchronous send, synchronous receive:** the sender is blocked until the receiver collects the message; the receiver waits for a message and is blocked until it arrives.
2. **Synchronous send, asynchronous receive:** the sender is blocked when the message is sent, but the receiver will continue whether or not a message is available. This is a very uncommon configuration.
3. **Asynchronous send, synchronous receive:** the sender continues execution when the message is sent, but the receiver will wait until the message is received before it can continue. This is the most common configuration; usually the receiver needs a message to continue.
4. **Asynchronous send, asynchronous receive:** the sender can continue as soon as it sends the message, and the receiver will check for a message but will continue whether or not the message is available.

There are three approaches we will consider on how we can accomplish IPC:

1. The file system. 
2. Message passing. 
3. Shared memory.

### File System 

Messages stored in the file system will be persistent and survive a reboot. 

It can also be used when the sender and receiver know nothing about one another (and the programmer knows nothing about any other IPC mechanisms).

The producer may write to a file in an agreed upon location and the consumer may read from that same location. The operating system is still involved because of its role in file creation and manipulation (as well as permissions for who may read and write a file).

### Message Queue

To deal with the process ID problem, what we would like is *indirect communication* where the messages are sent to mailboxes (queues). The queue is owned by the operating system, so it is persistent and independent of any particular process. 

#### ftok()

obtain a key that identifies a specific IPC structure

```c
#include sys/ipc.h 
key_t ftok( char *pathname, int proj );
```

- argument:
  - **pathname**: the given file name, which does have to exist
  - **proj**: allows generating multiple IPC objects based off the same file

#### msgget()

```c
int msgget( key_t key, int flag );
```

- argument
  - **key**: the key that we have previously generated
  - **flag**: the UNIX permissions
- return:
  - **int**: the queue ID of the queue we will use

#### struct msgbuf

```c
struct msgbuf { 
  long mtype;
	char mtext[1]; 
};
```

#### msgsnd()

```c
int msgsnd( int msqid, const void *ptr, size_t nbytes, int flag );
```

- argument
  - **msqid**: the queue we want to send it to
  - **ptr**: pointer to the message
  - **nbytes**: size of data that we want to send
  - **flag**: what happens if the queue is full
    - normally we want to wait, `0`
    - you can choose `IPC_NOWAIT`

#### msgrcv()

```c
ssize_t msgrcv( int msqid, void *ptr, size_t nbytes, long type, int flag );
```

- argument
  - **msqid**: the queue to receive from as per usual
  - **ptr**: pointer to the destination where the message will be copied to
  - **nbytes**: size of data that we want to send
  - **type**: used to specify what kind of message you want
    - type == 0: Return the first message on the queue (any type)
    - type > 0: Return the first message on the queue with the specified type
    - type < 0: Return the first message on the queue whose type is the smallest value less than or equal to the absolute value of type.
  - **flag**: what happens if the queue is full
    - normally we want to wait, `0`
    - you can choose `IPC_NOWAIT`

#### msgctl()

This deletes the queue as well as any data in the queue immediately.

```c
int msgctl( int msqid, int command, struct msqid_ds * buf );
```

- argument
  - **msqid**: the queue to receive from as per usual
  - **command**: `IPC_RMID`
  - **buf**: `NULL`

#### example: parent sends a message to the child process

```c
struct msg { 
  long mtype; 
  int data;
};
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
  // get an id
  int msgqid = msgget( key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT );
  
  int pid = fork();
  if ( pid > 0 ) { 
    /* Parent */
    struct msg m;
    m.mtype = 42;
    m.data = 252;
    msgsnd( msgqid, &m, sizeof( struct msg ), 0 );
  } else if ( pid == 0 ) { 
    /* Child */
  	struct msg m2;
  	msgrcv( msgqid, &m2, sizeof( struct msg ), 42, 0 ); 		
    printf("Received %d!\n", m2.data );
  	msgctl( msgqid, IPC_RMID, NULL );
  }
	return 0; 
}
```



### Signal 

UNIX systems use signals to indicate events (e.g., the Ctrl-C on the console). 

A signal is, interestingly, a form of inter-process communication: you are sending a signal from one process to another, even if it’s your terminal doing the sending. When we have more than one process, we might want them to communicate, so we should look into how to make that happen.

By default, the kernel will handle any signal that is sent to a process with the default handler (listed in the signal table).

Alternatively, a process may inform the operating system it is prepared to handle the signal itself (such as doing some cleanup when the Ctrl-C is received instead of just dying). In any event, a signal needs to be handled, even if the handling is to ignore it. 

Note that the signals `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored. 

#### Signal Table

| Signal    | Comment                                       | Value    | Default Action                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `SIGHUP`  | Hangup detected                               | 1        | Terminate process                  |
| `SIGINT`  | Keyboard interrupt (Ctrl-C)                   | 2        | Terminate process                  |
| `SIGQUIT` | Quit from keyboard                            | 3        | Terminate process, dump debug info |
| `SIGILL`  | Illegal instruction                           | 4        | Terminate process, dump debug info |
| `SIGKILL` | Kill signal                                   | 9        | Terminate process                  |
| `SIGSEGV` | Segmentation fault (invalid memory reference) | 11       | Terminate process, dump debug info |
| `SIGTERM` | Termination signal                            | 15       | Terminate process                  |
| `SIGCHLD` | Child stopped or terminated                   | 20,17,18 | Ignore                             |
| `SIGCONT` | Continue if stopped                           | 19,18,25 | Continue the process if stopped    |
| `SIGSTOP` | Stop process                                  | 18,20,24 | Stop process                       |

#### kill() + raise()

```c
#include signal.h
int kill( int pid, int signo );
int raise( int signo );
```

- argument:
  - `kill()`
    - pid > 0:  send the signal to the process with process ID pid.
    - pid = 0: send the signal to all processes in the same process group as the caller.
    - pid = -1: send the signal to all processes for which the calling process has permission to send a signal, except init and the calling process. Broadcast, basically.
    - pid < -1: send the signal to all processes whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.
    - signo = 0: null signal, 
      - It does not actually send any signal, but can be used to check if the recipient process exists. If not, the errno return value of ESRCH tells you that it no longer exists
  - `raise()` sends signal to current process

- return:
  - 0: successful
  - -1: unsuccessful

#### Register Signal Handler

when the signal arrives, there are three options (1) ignore it, (2) run a signal handler, and (3) run the default action. 

```c
void (*signal( int signo, void (*handler)(int))) (int);
```

- argument:
  - **signo**: Signal number to watch for
  - **handler**: Function to run to handle the signal.
- content of handler function:
  - avoid:  printf, malloc, free, and anything that could possibly block the process (e.g., a read of a file!). 

##### example: register signal handler

```c
//register a signal handler
signal( SIGINT, sig_handler );
void sig_handler ( int signal_num ) { 
  /* Handle the signal in some way */
}
```

#### sigprocmask()

```c
int sigprocmask( int how, const sigset_t * set, sigset_t * old_set );
```

- argument 
  - **how**: what we would like to do here
    - **SIG_BLOCK**: the signals pointed to by set are added to the block list; 
    - **SIG_UNBLOCK**:  then the ones in set are removed from the block list; 
    - **SIG_SETMASK**: then set is assigned to the signal mask (overwrite all current values)
  - **set**: set of signal
  - **old_set (optional)**: if a pointer is provided then upon a change to the signal mask, old_set is updated to contain the values from before the change.

#### Signal Blocking Helper Functions

```c
int sigemptyset( sigset_t *set ); /* Initialize an empty sigset_t */
int sigaddset( sigset_t *set, int signal ); /* Add specified signal to set */
int sigfillset( sigset_t *set ); /* Add ALL signals to set */
int sigdelset( sigset_t *set, int signal ); /* Remove specified signal from set */ 
int sigismember( sigset_t *set, int signal ); /* Returns 1 if true, 0 if false */
```

##### Example: signal blocking 

```c
sigset_t set;
sigset_t previous;
sigemptyset( &set ); /* Initialize set */ 

sigaddset( &set, SIGINT ); /* Add SIGINT to it */
sigprocmask( SIG_BLOCK, &set, &previous ); /* Add SIGINT to the mask */ 

/* SIGINT is blocked in this section */
sigprocmask( SIG_SETMASK, &previous, NULL ); /* Restore previous mask */
```

#### pause()

pause suspends your program until the signal handler runs. 

```c
#include <unistd.h>
int pause(void);
```

- return:
  - always returns -1

### UNIX Pipes

#### Pipe

Pipe as a way for communication between a producer and consumer. 

- The producer writes in one end of the pipe and the consumer receives it on the other. 
- unidirectional: using 1 pipe
- bidirectional: using 2 pipes

Pipe is a block of main memory that is interpreted as a circular queue, and each entry in the queue is fixed in size and usually one character.

#### pipe()

thinks of a pipe as a file

pipe lives in memory and need parent-child relation

```c
pipe( int fileDescriptors[]);
/*
fileDescriptors[0] is the read-end; 
fileDescriptors[1] is the write-end.
*/
```

#### Named Pipe

- A UNIX pipe may be stored on disk if we make one.

- Regular pipes require a parent-child process relationship. Named pipes do not.

- Named pipes are also bidirectional, but one direction at a time.

If we wanted to create a named pipe, the system call for that is `mkfifo()` (make first-in-first-out) because sometimes a named pipe is called a FIFO. As it is a file, it can be manipulated with the usual UNIX file system calls: open,read, write, and close

#### Example: parent sent a message to child via Pipe

```c
#include <string.h> 
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 25 
#define READ_END 0 
#define WRITE_END 1
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
	char write_msg[BUFFER_SIZE] = "Greetings"; 
  char read_msg[BUFFER_SIZE];
	int fd[2];
	pid_t pid;

  // create a pipe
  if (pipe(fd) == -1) { 
    fprintf(stderr,"Pipe failed"); 
    return 1;
	}
  //fork
  pid = fork();
  if (pid < 0) { 
    /* error occurred */
    fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed");
  	return 1; 
  }
  
  if (pid > 0) { 
    /* parent process */
  	/* close the unused end of the pipe */ 		
    close(fd[READ_END]);
    /* write to the pipe */
  	write(fd[WRITE_END], write_msg, strlen(write_msg)+1);
    /* close the write end of the pipe */
    close(fd[WRITE_END]);
  } 
  
  else { 
    /* child process */
  	/* close the unused end of the pipe */ 
    close(fd[WRITE_END]);
    /* read from the pipe */
    memset(read_msg, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
    read(fd[READ_END], read_msg, BUFFER_SIZE);
    printf("read %s",read_msg);
    /* close the write end of the pipe */
    close(fd[READ_END]);
  }
  return 0; 
}

```

### Shared Memory - shm

#### Generate Key

Suppose we want to share a section of memory. We need to obtain a *key* that identifies a specific memory segment. The way to obtain the key is the same as we previously discussed for message-passing: Either using the constant `IPC_PRIVATE`, or creating the key with the “file to key” function found in `sys/ipc.h`

```c
#include sys/ipc.h
key_t ftok( char *pathname, int proj )
```

A process that wants to attach to the memory has to know the key (or ID) to find it. If we created the segment ourselves, we obviously know where it is. But presumably you want some other process to have it as well. If two processes use the same input values for ftok() they will get the same result, so that’s one method. Or, if a parent attaches a shared memory segment and then calls fork(), the child inherits the shared memory segments, so it’s is already set up.

#### shmget()

Create a new shared memory segment

```c
#include sys/shm.h
int shmget( key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg );
```

- argument
  - **key**: either the result of a `ftok()` call or the constant `IPC_PRIVATE`
  - **size**: the number of bytes the shared memory should be
  - **shmflg**: UNIX permissions
- return: 
  - **int**: shmid, the integer identifier of the shared memory segment

#### shmat()

Attach the shared memory segment (add the shared segment to the process calling attach)

```c
#include sys/shm.h
void* shmat( int shmid, const void* shmaddr, int shmflg ); 
```

- argument
  - **shmid**: return from `shmget()`
  - **shmaddr**: use `NULL`
  - **shmflg**: `SHM_RDONLY` which would prevent writing (actually an attempt would result in a segmentation fault)
- return: 
  - void pointer: the address of the shared memory.

#### shmdt

Detach, from the shared memory segment (like deallocation, if forgotten then it will happen automatically when a process ends) 

```c
#include sys/shm.h
int shmdt( const void* shmaddr );
```

- argument
  - **shmaddr**: argument returned by `shmat()`

#### shmctl()

Delete the shared memory segment (after all currently attached processes have detached), done by one process only

```c
#include sys/shm.h
int shmctl( int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf )
```

- argument
  - **shmid**: a integer returned by `shmget()` 
  - **cmd**: `IPC_RMID` (“remove ID”)
  - **buf**: `NULL`

#### example: child process send a message to parent vis shm

```c
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <sys/shm.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
  // create shared memory
  int shmid = shmget( IPC_PRIVATE, 32, IPC_CREAT | 0666 );
  
  int pid = fork();
  if ( pid > 0 ) { 
    /* Parent */
 		waitpid( pid, NULL, 0 );
  	void* mem = shmat( shmid, NULL, 0 );
  	printf("The message the parent received from the child is %s.\n", (char*) mem ); 
    shmdt( mem );
  	shmctl( shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL );
  } 
  
  else if ( pid == 0 ) { 
    /* Child */ 
    void* mem = shmat( shmid, NULL, 0 ); 
    memset( mem, 0, 32 );
  	sprintf( mem, "Hello World" ); 
    shmdt( mem );
  }
  return 0; 
}
```

### Shared-Memory-mmap

An alternative approach for shared memory involves the use of `mmap()`, a function nominally used to <u>map a file into memory</u>. 

This is neat – it would allow us to map some disk file to a buffer, so when we fetch data from that buffer, the data is read and when we write into the buffer the data is written to the file. It allows us to read and write files as if they were memory accesses. 

![page6image8689552.png](/Users/shuyi/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/page6image8689552.png) 

#### mmap()

```c
void* mmap( void* address, size_t length, int protection, int flag, int fd, off_t offset ); 
```

- argument
  - **address**: `NULL`
  - **length**: the number of bytes we want to map
  - **protection**: the protection rules — read, write execute, and none 
    - `PROT_NONE`, `PROT_READ`, `PROT_WRITE`, and `PROT_EXECUTE`
  - **flag**: the mode that the memory will be mapped in
    - `MAP_PRIVATE` – modifications are not visible to other processes mapping the same file and are not written out to the underlying file. 
    - `MAP_SHARED` – modifications are visible to other processes and are written to the underlying file (although perhaps not instantly – there is a function to make sure we all agree).
  - **fd**: file descriptor of the file we wish to map
  - **offset**: the offset from the start of the file where the segment begins
- return: 
  - void pointer: a pointer to the starting address of the memory area where the file is mapped

#### mprotect()

```c
//change protection rule
int mprotect( void* address, size_t length, int prot );
```

- argument:
  - **address**:
  - **length**: the number of bytes we want to map
  - **prot**: new access rules

#### msync()

When a piece of the file is loaded in memory in the shared mode, file changes are not necessarily written out to the underlying file immediately. This is (partly) a performance enhancement but can mean that not everybody agrees on the content of the file because a change has not yet been written to disk.

```c
int msync( void* address, size_t length, int flags );
```

- argument:
  - **address**:
  - **length**: the number of bytes we want to map
  - **flags**: `MS_SYNC`

#### munmap

A segment would be unmapped automatically when a process exits

```c
int munmap( void* address, size_t length );
```

- argument:
  - **address**:
  - **length**: the number of bytes we want to map

#### example: a child process updates a message for parent

```c
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <sys/shm.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <sys/wait.h> 
#include <sys/stat.h> 
#include <fcntl.h> 
#include <sys/mman.h>
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
  // get a file fd
  int fd = open( "example.txt", O_RDWR );
  struct stat st;
  stat( "example.txt", &st );
  ssize_t size = st.st_size;
  
  // use mmap()
  void* mapped = mmap( NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0 );
  
  // fork()
  int pid = fork();
  if ( pid > 0 ) { 
    /* Parent */
  	waitpid( pid, NULL, 0 );
  	printf("The new content of the file is: %s.\n", (char*) mapped); 
    munmap( mapped, size );
  } 
  
  else if ( pid == 0 ) { 
    /* Child */
  	memset( mapped, 0, size ); 
    /* Erase what’s there */ 
    sprintf( mapped, "It is now Overwritten");
		/* Ensure data is synchronized */
    msync( mapped, size, MS_SYNC );
    munmap( mapped, size );
 	}
  return 0; 
}
```
