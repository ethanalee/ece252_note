## Asynchronous (non-blocking) I/O

### blocking IO

```c
int fd = open( "example.txt", O_RDONLY );
int bytes_read = read( fd, buffer, num_bytes ); 
close( fd );
```

### Non blocking

```c
int fd = open( "example.txt", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK );
int bytes_read = read( fd, buffer, num_bytes ); /* Returns instantly! */ 
close( fd );
```

- opened the file in non-blocking, 
- the read call returns instantly

## Asynchronous (non-blocking) I/O for Socket

### 1. blocking IO (Normal)

If we haven’t received something, we would get blocked waiting for some data to arrive.

### 2. non-blocking IO + polling

#### fcntl() + O_NONBLOCK

Calls to `accept()`, `recv()`, or `recvfrom()` would not block.

If you call those and there’s no data to receive, you get back a return value of `-1` and `errno` is going to be either `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`. 

```c
sockfd = socket( PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 );
fcntl( sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK );
```

### 3. using select()

#### fd_set functions

`fd_set` represents a set of file descriptors

Four functions for manipulating a set

```c
void FD_ZERO( fd_set *set ); 				/* Clear the set */
void FD_SET( int fd, fd_set *set ); /* Add fd to the set */
void FD_CLR( int fd, fd_set *set ); /* Remove fd from the set */
int FD_ISSET( int fd, fd_set *set); /* Tests if fd is a part of the set */
```

#### struct timeval

```c
struct timeval {
	long tv_sec; /* seconds */
	long tv_usec; /* microseconds */ 
};
```

#### select()

`select()` allows us to monitor a group of sockets, telling us about the state of each of them.

- telling us about the state of each of them
  - ready for a read
  - ready for a write 
  - an exception 

If we call this function, we’ll get blocked until something happens on one of the sockets so that it becomes “ready” – data is available to read, space is available to write, etc. or until we reach a timeout. 

```c
int select( int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout );
```

- argument
  - **nfds**: the value of the highest number file descriptor in any of the three sets plus 1
  - **readfds**: sockets we are interested in reading from, or `NULL` 
  - **writefds**: those we are interested in writing from, or `NULL` 
  - **exceptfds**: for sockets that are in an exceptional state, or `NULL` 
  - **timeout**: a maximum amount of time we are willing to wait
    - if both field are 0: then select() returns immediately
    - if `NULL` is given, we will wait as long as it takes for something – anything – to happen.
    - if timeout is reach, but nothing occurs, then select() returns. 
- return

#### Example:

```c
void listen_for_connections( int service1_sock, int service2_sock, int service3_sock ) { 
  int nfds = 1 + (service1_sock > service2_sock
      ? service1_sock > service3_sock ? service1_sock : service3_sock
			: service2_sock > service3_sock ? service2_sock : service3_sock);
	fd_set s;
	struct timeval tv;
	printf( "Going to start listening for socket events.\n" );

  while( !quit ) {
    FD_ZERO( &s );
    FD_SET( service1_sock, &s );
    FD_SET( service2_sock, &s );
    FD_SET( service3_sock, &s );
    tv.tv_sec = 30;
    tv.tv_usec = 0;
		int res = select( nfds, &s, NULL, NULL, &tv ); 
    if ( res == -1 ) { 
      /* An error occurred */
			printf( "An error occurred in select(): %s.\n", strerror( errno ) );
			quit = 1;
		} else if ( res == 0 ) { 
      /* 0 sockets had events occur */
			printf( "Still waiting; nothing occurred recently.\n" ); 
    } else { 
      /* Things happened */
			if ( FD_ISSET( service1_sock, &s ) {
        service1_activate( );
			}
      if ( FD_ISSET( service2_sock, &s ) {
        service2_activate( );
      }
      if ( FD_ISSET( service3_sock, &s ) { 
        service3_activate( );
      } 
    }
	}
}
```

a pretty good idea of how this would work). When people want to join the chat room they send a message to a server. The server accepts and opens the connection and adds the client to the chat room. But people don’t always talk. So if nothing is happening right now there’s nothing to send. So the server can use select() to keep an eye open for when someone has said something. Either way, we would wait for something to happen, either on one of the sockets from a current client, or the socket for accepting incoming connections.

If it’s the socket for accepting incoming connections that activated then accept the incoming connection, and add the new socket to the list that we are going to listen to. A chat server might choose to send a notification to other clients to let them know that a new person has joined the chat. That would be a write to the sockets that represent connected clients.

If another socket activated, most likely someone had something to say. So we can read from the socket that is ready to read and pass on the message that we received to all the other clients. Except, sometimes there isn’t one! A socket will show up as being ready for reading if it has closed. But the call to read will return 0 (or a negative number) if the socket has closed (i.e., the client has disconnected). If the connection has been closed, then we should remove that socket from the list that we are interested in. And also we sometimes send a message telling other clients that a person has left the chat.

And when a message is received from a client, then of course the thing for the server to do is to send it on to the other clients, by writing to their sockets so the message is transmitted to them. The clients are waiting to receive messages and will then show them to the user when someone says something. And then look at that: you’re talking to other people on the internet! Just remember not to give out your personal information to strangers.

Obviously there are some other considerations that come with managing a chat server. There might be periodic connection-keep-alive kind of messages so that clients remain connected even if nobody is talking right now. And you might want the ability to kick out people who are spammers and perhaps even ban them, amongst other things. But the goal of this explanation wasn’t really to learn how to write a chat server in great detail – just to give an example of how you could use select to write something useful.

### 4. pselect()

#### struct timespec

```c
struct timespec {
long tv_sec; /* seconds */
long tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */
};
```

- use nano seconds instead of milliseconds

#### pselect()

```c
int pselect( int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, const struct timespec *timeout, const sigset_t *sigmask );
```

- **sigmask**: allows us to change the signal mask atomically in the same step as the call to select



```c
ready = pselect( nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds, timeout, &sigmask );
```

is same as following

```c
sigset_t origmask;
pthread_sigmask( SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask );

ready = select( nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds, timeout ); pthread_sigmask( SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL );
```

### 4. poll()

#### struct pollfd

```c
struct pollfd {
	int fd; /* file descriptor */ 
  short events; /* requested events */ 
  short revents; /* returned events */
};
```

- fd: the file descriptor to watch
- event: what events we want to wait for on this file descriptor
  - **POLLIN**: read
  - **POLLOUT**: write
  - **POLLPRI**: exception
- revents: set by the kernel so we can find out what happened.
  - **POLLERR**: if an error occurred
  - **POLLHUP**: if the other side ended the connection
  - **POLLNVAL**: if there’s a problem with the socket (e.g., uninitialized)

#### poll()

it is used to watch file descriptors and see if any of them are ready for an I/O operation

```c
int poll( struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout );
```

- argument:
  - **fds**: structure for passing in the sockets we wish to monitor.
  - **nfds**: the number of items in the array
  - **timeout**: the number of milliseconds to wait before returning with zero meaning don’t wait at all, and a negative number meaning wait infinitely.
- return
  - The return value will be constructed as a bitwise OR of the fields as well, 
    - **POLLIN**: read
    - **POLLOUT**: write
    - **POLLPRI**: exception
    - **POLLERR**: if an error occurred
    - **POLLHUP**: if the other side ended the connection
    - **POLLNVAL**: if there’s a problem with the socket (e.g., uninitialized

#### example:

```c
void listen_for_connections( int service1_sock, int service2_sock, int service3_sock ) { 
  struct pollfd pollfds[3];
	pollfds[0].fd = service1_sock;
	pollfds[0].events = POLLIN;
  pollfds[1].fd = service2_sock;
  pollfds[1].events = POLLIN;
  pollfds[2].fd = service3_sock;
  pollfds[2].events = POLLIN;
  int timeout = 30 * 1000; /* 30 seconds in ms */
	printf( "Going to start listening for socket events.\n" );

  while( !quit ) {
		int res = poll( &pollfds, 3, timeout );
		if ( res == -1 ) { 
      /* An error occurred */
			printf( "An error occurred in select(): %s.\n", strerror( errno ) );
			quit = 1;
		} else if ( res == 0 ) { 
      /* 0 sockets had events occur */
			printf( "Still waiting; nothing occurred recently.\n" ); 
    } else { 
      /* Things happened */
      if ( pollfds[0].revents & POLLIN ) { 
        service1_activate( );
      }
      if ( pollfds[1].revents & POLLIN ) {
        service2_activate( );
      }
      if ( pollfds[2].revents & POLLIN ) { 
        service3_activate( );
      } 
  	}
  }   
}                                                                                 
```



## Using cURL Asynchronously

### Asynchronous usage

#### 1. initialization 

```c
// global initialization
curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);

// multi handler initialization
curl_multi_init();

// easy handler initialization 
curl_easy_init();
```

#### 2. curl_multi_add_handle()

add easy-handler to multi-handler

```c
curl_multi_add_handle( CURLM* cm, CURL* eh );
```

- argument:
  - **cm**: curl multi handler
  - **eh**: curl easy handler

#### 3. curl_multi_perform()

Dispatch them all at one

```c
curl_multi_perform( CURLM* cm, int* still_running )
```

- argument:
  - **cm**: curl multi handler
  - **still_running**: a pointer to an integer that is updated with the number of the easy handles in that multi handle that are still running
    - **0**: they are all done.
    - **non-zero**: some of them are still in progress

#### 4. curl_multi_wait() 

This function will block the current thread until something happens (some event occurs).

```c
CURLMcode curl_multi_wait( CURLM *multi_handle, struct curl_waitfd extra_fds[], unsigned int extra_nfds, int timeout_ms, int *numfds );
```

- argument:
  - **multi_handle**: multi handler
  - **extra_fds[ ]**:  `NULL`
  - **extra_nfds**: 0
  - **timeout_ms**: maximum time to wait
  - **numfds**: pointer that will be updated with the actual number of “interesting” events that occurred (interesting is the word used in the specifications, and what it means is mysterious)

#### 5. curl_multi_info_read()

check status code and return code

`curl_multi_info_read` tells the status of the request and returns a pointer to information “next” easy handle, if there is one.

```c
CURLMsg* curl_multi_info_read( CURLM* cm, int* msgs_left )
```

- argument:
  - **cm**: curl multi handler
  - **msgs_left**: updated based on how many messages remain
- return 
- CURLMsg* : a pointer to a struct of type CURLMsg
  - message->msg : 
    - CURLMSG_DONE: request completed
    - other: request is in progress
  - message->data.result:
    - CURLE_OK: everything succeeded
  - message->easy_handle:
    - easy handler

#### 6. Clean up

```c
curl_multi_remove_handle( CURLM* cm, CURL* eh );
curl_easy_cleanup( CURL* eh );
curl_multi_cleanup( CURLM * cm );
curl_global_cleanup(); 
```

`eh` is pointer to it is inside the CURLMsg under `m->easy_handle`. 

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <curl/multi.h>
#define MAX_WAIT_MSECS 30*1000 /* Wait max. 30 seconds */

const char *urls[] = { 
  "http://www.microsoft.com", 
  "http://www.yahoo.com", 
  "http://www.wikipedia.org", 
  "http://slashdot.org"
};

#define CNT 4
size_t cb(char *d, size_t n, size_t l, void *p) {
	/* take care of the data here, ignored in this example */ 	
  return n*l;
}
void init( CURLM *cm, int i ) {
  CURL *eh = curl_easy_init();
  curl_easy_setopt( eh, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, cb ); 
  curl_easy_setopt( eh, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0L ); 
  curl_easy_setopt( eh, CURLOPT_URL, urls[i] ); 
  curl_easy_setopt( eh, CURLOPT_PRIVATE, urls[i]) ; 
  curl_easy_setopt( eh, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 0L ); 
  curl_multi_add_handle( cm, eh );
}

int main( int argc, char** argv ) { 
  CURLM *cm = NULL;
	CURL *eh = NULL;
  
	CURLMsg *msg = NULL;
	CURLcode return_code = 0; 
  int still_running = 0; 
  int msgs_left = 0;
	int http_status_code; 
  const char *szUrl;
  
  /* 1. initialize */ 
  curl_global_init( CURL_GLOBAL_ALL );
  cm = curl_multi_init( );
  
	for ( int i = 0; i < CNT; ++i ) { 
    /* 2. init 4 easy handler and add them to multi handler*/ 
    init( cm, i );
	}
  
  /* 3. multi perform*/
  curl_multi_perform( cm, &still_running );
	
  /* 4. wait all of them finish*/
  do {
    int numfds = 0;
    int res = curl_multi_wait( cm, NULL, 0, MAX_WAIT_MSECS, &numfds ); 
    if( res != CURLM_OK ) {
      fprintf( stderr, "error: curl_multi_wait() returned %d\n", res );
      return EXIT_FAILURE; 
    }
    curl_multi_perform( cm, &still_running );
  } while( still_running );
  
  /* 5. read message if there is one*/
	while ( ( msg = curl_multi_info_read( cm, &msgs_left ) ) ) { 
    if ( msg->msg == CURLMSG_DONE ) {
      eh = msg->easy_handle;
      return_code = msg->data.result; 
      if ( return_code != CURLE_OK ) {
        fprintf( stderr, "CURL error code: %d\n", msg->data.result );
        curl_multi_remove_handle( cm, eh );
        curl_easy_cleanup( eh );
        continue;
      }

      // Get HTTP status code
      http_status_code = 0;
      szUrl = NULL;
      curl_easy_getinfo( eh, CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE, &http_status_code ); 
      curl_easy_getinfo( eh, CURLINFO_PRIVATE, &szUrl );
      if( http_status_code == 200 ) {
        printf( "200 OK for %s\n", szUrl ) ;
      } else {
        fprintf( stderr, "GET of %s returned http status code %d\n", szUrl, http_status_code );
      }
      curl_multi_remove_handle( cm, eh );
      curl_easy_cleanup( eh ); 
    } else {
			fprintf( stderr, "error: after curl_multi_info_read(), CURLMsg=%d\n", msg->msg ); }
  	}
  
  // 6. clean up 
  curl_multi_cleanup( cm ); 
  curl_global_cleanup(); 
  return 0;
}
```

### Asynchronous +curl + select()

#### 1. initialization + add handler

```c
// global initialization
curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);

// multi handler initialization
curl_multi_init();

// easy handler initialization 
curl_easy_init();

// add easy handler to multi handler
curl_multi_add_handle( CURLM* cm, CURL* eh );
```

#### 2. curl_multi_fdset()

This fills in the values of `dread` and `maxfd` for us, which is some of what, but not everything that, we need. When calling select we still have to put a +1 on the max file descriptor, but that is no big deal.

```c
CURLMcode curl_multi_fdset( CURLM *multi_handle, fd_set *read_fd_set, fd_set *write_fd_set, fd_set *exc_fd_set, int *max_fd );
```

- argument
  - **multi_handle**: multi handler
  - **read_fd_set**: pointer to a fd_set
    - It’s the responsibility of the caller to set these to zero with FD_ZERO before calling this
  - **write_fd_set**: pointer to a fd_set
  - **exc_fd_set**: pointer to a fd_set
  - **max_fd**:the maximum file descriptor is, or `NULL`

##### example

```c
fd_set fdr; 
fd_set fdw; 
fd_set fde; 
FD_ZERO( &fdr ); 
FD_ZERO( &fdw ); 
FD_ZERO( &fde ); 
int maxfd = -1;
CURLMCode res = curl_multi_fdset( cm, &fdr, &fdw, &fde, &maxfd );
```

#### 3. curl_multi_timeout()

add time out

```c
CURLMcode curl_multi_timeout( CURLM *multi_handle, long *timeout );
```

- argument:
  - **multi_handle**: multi handler
  - **timeout**: a pointer to long

##### example: timeout

```c
struct timeval timeout; 
long timeo;

curl_multi_timeout( cm, &timeo ); 
if(timeo < 0) {
  /* no set timeout, use a default */
	timeo = 980; 
}
timeout.tv_sec = timeo / 1000;
timeout.tv_usec = (timeo % 1000) * 1000;
```

#### 4. start tranfer that use the sockets

call `curl_multi_perform()`

#### 5. call select()

#### 6. read info

When we wake up, it is because something happened, and we still use curl_multi_info_read to find out what’s going on with a given easy handle and find out its status and also find out how many are still running. 

As with the earlier code where we used select on sockets directly, we have to remember to reset (repopulate) the values that are passed to that function before the next iteration of the loop.



## Asynchronous I/O with AIO

### Using AIO

using the POSIX Asynchronous I/O Interface

#### struct aiocb

```c
#include aio.h
struct aiocb {
  int aio_fildes; 				/* File descriptor */
  off_t aio_offset; 			/* Offset for I/O */
  volatile void* aio_buf; /* Buffer */
  size_t aio_nbytes; 			/* Number of bytes to transfer */
  int aio_reqprio; 				/* Request priority */
  struct sigevent aio_sigevent; /* Signal Info */
  int aio_lio_opcode; 		/* Operation for List I/O */
};
```

- **aio_fildes**: the file descriptor of the file we would like to read or write; 
- **aio_offset**: the offset is how far into the file we start the operation. 
  - The offset does nothing if the file has been opened in “append” mode.
- **aio_buf**: The buffer pointer for the source (for a write) or destination (for a read). 
- **aio_nbytes**: Number of bytes to transfer
- **aio_reqprio**: a suggestion that we can provide as to how the AIO events should be scheduled, but the operating system is free to ignore this if it wishes (ignore it here)
- **aio_sigevent**: signal event
- **aio_lio_opcode**: used if submit a group of AIO requests in a single operation
  - **LIO_READ**, 
  - **LIO_WRITE**,
  - **LIO_NOP** (this one means do nothing) 

#### struct sigevent

```c
struct sigevent {
	int sigev_notify; 				/* Notify Type */
	int sigev_signo; 					/* Signal number */
	union sigval sigev_value; /* Notify argument */
	void* (*sigev_notify_function) (union sigval); 
  													/* Notify Function */
  pthread_attr_t *sigev_notify_attributes; 
  													/* Notify attributes */
};
```

- **sigev_notify**: notify type 
  - **SIGEV_NONE**: Don’t do anything when the request completes.
  - **SIGEV_SIGNAL**: The signal specified in the **sigev_signo**(signal number field) is generated when the request is complete.
  - **SIGEV_THREAD**: The function specified in the notify function field is executed, in a different, detached thread. 
- **sigev_signo**: signal number
- **sigev_value**: The argument to the "callback" function specified
- **sigev_notify_attributes**: can use to override the attributes of the thread (including whether it is detached)

####  struct sigval

A `sigval` is either an integer or a void* pointer.

```c
union sigval {
	int sival_int; 
  void* sival_ptr;
};
```

#### aio_read() + aio_write()

enqueue 1 request

```c
int aio_read( struct aiocb* aiocb ); 
int aio_write( struct aiocb* aiocb );
```

#### lio_listio()

enqueue a list of requests all in one go 

```c
int lio_listio( int mode, struct aiocb * const list[], int nent, struct sigevent* sigev );
```

- **mode**: 
  - **LIO_WAIT**: the function doesn’t return until all the operations are complete, and last argument is ignored
  - **LIO_NOWAIT**: as soon as the I/O requests are queued the function returns and we can go on
- **list[ ]**: list (array) of control blocks
- **nent**: the number of entries in that list (array)
- **sigev**: an event that will fire once all operations are complete

#### aio_error()

The `aio_error` function tells you what the status of the operation is. 

```c
int aio_error( const struct aiocb* aiocb ); 
```

- returns: 
  - **0**: success
  - **-1**: fail, errno tells the reason
  - **EINPROGRESS**: the operation is still waiting to run or in progress
  - other: error code

#### aio_return()

If the operation completed successfully, `aio_return` will get the return value from the read or write operation. 

Calling this while the operation in still progress returns undefined results and potentially fails. 

We can call this only once per AIO operation; once the value has been collected then some internal structures can be deallocated, so it is polite to call it even if you do not need it.

```c
ssize_t aio_return( const struct aiocb* aiocb );
```

#### aio_suspend()

`aio_suspend` allows us to block until one of the AIO operations in the list is complete, or the timeout elapses. 

```c
int aio_suspend( const struct aiocb *const list[], int nent, const struct timespec* timeout );
```

- argument:
  - **list**[ ]: an array of the control blocks
  - **nent**: the size of this array
  - **timeout**: timeout structure
- return: 
  - **-1**: the timeout does occur
  - **0**: any AIO request finishes

If everything was finished already by the time this function was called, the function does not block.

#### Cancel()

aio_cancel is called when an AIO request is no longer needed

```c
int aio_cancel( int fd, struct aiocb* aiocb );
```

- argument:
  - **fd**: the file descriptor with the AIO operations
  - **aiocb**: the specific request we wish to cancel
    - If `NULL` is given as the control block argument, then it tries to cancel all outstanding asynchronous I/O requests for that file.
- return:
  - **AIO_CANCELLED**: The requested operation(s) have been cancelled.
  - **AIO_NOTCANCELLED**: At least one operation could not be cancelled
  - **AIO_ALLDONE**: All operations finished before they could be cancelled.
  - **-1**: Something went wrong in cancelling; errno set.

#### example: normal 

```c
void process( char* buffer ); /* Implementation not shown */

int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
	char* buffer1 = malloc( MAX_SIZE * sizeof( char )); 
  char* buffer2 = malloc( MAX_SIZE * sizeof( char ));
  
	int fd = open( argv[1], O_RDONLY );
	memset( buffer1, 0, MAX_SIZE * sizeof( char )); 
  read( fd, buffer1, MAX_SIZE );
	close( fd );
  
	for ( int i = 2; i < argc; i++ ) {
    int nextFD = open( argv[i], O_RDONLY );
    
    struct aiocb cb;
    memset( &cb, 0, sizeof( struct aiocb ));
    cb.aio_nbytes = MAX_SIZE;
    cb.aio_fildes = nextFD;
    cb.aio_offset = 0;
    memset( buffer2, 0, MAX_SIZE * sizeof( char )); 
    cb.aio_buf = buffer2;
    aio_read( &cb );
    process( buffer1 );
    
    while( aio_error( &cb ) == EINPROGRESS ) { 
      sleep( 1 );
    }
    aio_return( &cb ); /* This frees some internal structures */ 		
    close( nextFD );
    char* tmp = buffer1; 
    buffer1 = buffer2; 
    buffer2 = tmp;
  }
  process( buffer1 );
  free( buffer1 );
  free( buffer2 );
	return 0; 
}
```

#### example: callback

```c
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <aio.h> 
#include <fcntl.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <errno.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <pthread.h>
#define MAX_SIZE 512

void worker( union sigval argument) {
	char* buffer = (char*) argument.sival_ptr;
	printf("Worker thread here. Buffer contains: %s\n", buffer);
  free( buffer );
