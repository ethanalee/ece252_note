## Introduction to C

This summary covers material from Lecture 1 (introduction), Lecture 24 (Tool), Lecture 25 (Inclass 3)

C is a procedural language and it is not Object-Oriented.

### Header File

if you receive a warning about “implicit declaration” of a function it means that a header is missing but the compiler can guess about what you want.

```c
#include <stdbool.h> //define bool, true, false
#include <stdio.h> //i/o: printf(), scanf(), getf()
#include <stdlib.h> //memory allocation: malloc(), free(), NULL
```

### Main Args

command line argument example

```c
# include <stdia.h>
# include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv){
	//argv: argument vector => char * argv[] 
  //argc: argument count
  if (argc==2){
    printf("%d \n",atoi(argv[1]))
  }
}
```

1. name the file as `printint.c`
2. compile `gcc -std=c99 -o printint printint.c`
3. execute `./printint 17`
4. then

```c
argc = 2
argv[0] = "./printint"
argc[1] = "17"
```

### Comments

```c
/*
* this 
* is
* a 
* block
* comment
*/ 

// this is a single line comment
```

### Printing

```c
printf("Hello world \n");
printf("%s if 5d years old and %f meters tall \n", "Andrew", 49, 1.9)
//variadic function 

// %f, %e, %g - double
// %d, %i - int
// %c - char
// %s -string
// %p - pointer
// %x - hexadecimal 
```

### Calling Convention, Errno

```c
int init_header(struct header *h, int v1, double v2);
// header: modified parameter comes first; header
// int: result code => by convention 0=good

#include <errno.h>
// define a error code 
extern int errno;

int *x = malloc(sizeof(int)); //if malloc has an error, it return null pointer
if (x == NULL){
  perror(0) //perror = print error; cannot allocate memory
  //strerror= string error
}
//enomem
```

### Function 

delcare function prototype before use 

```c
int function_name (type v1, type v2); //prototype
int function_name (type arg1, type arg2){ 
	return v1*v2
}
```

### Variables

declare where you need them

define `gcc -std=c99` in compiler

```c
void loop1(){
	for(int i=0; i<10; i++){ //declare int is allowed in C99
		...
	}
}
```

#### Constants

```c
#define BUDER_SIZE 1000 //typically called macro

#define SQR(x) x*x
int y=SQR(1+2); //problem: y=1+2*1+2=5
#define SQR(x) ((x)*(x))

const int y=9; // read only
```

#### Arrays



```c
int array[10] = {0}; // 0 specified the first element =0, rest of element is default to 0 (on stack) array= 00000 00000
int array[10] = {1}; // array = 10000 00000
```

dynamically allocated

```c
int *array1 = malloc(10*sizeof(int))
for (int i =0, i<10; i++){
  array1[i] = 0
}


// or 
#include <string.h>
int *array1 = malloc(10*sizeof(int));
// memset( void *pointer, unsigned char, # of bytes)
memset(array1, 0, 10*sizeof(int)); 
```

#### String

null-terminated char array

```c
char s[] = "abc"; //abc is string literal, s will use 4 char
```

#### void pointer

pointer of no type: can be cast inplicitly to any pointer type

```c
void *p; // 

int *i = p;
int *d = p;

// - first parameter of memset()
// - return type of malloc()
```

#### Structure

- no classes 
- structs ahve data member only -all public 

```c
struct point { //point is a tag
	double x;
	double y;
	double z;
}

struct point p1; 
p1.x = 1.9; // access by dot operator(.)
p1.y = 2.5;
p1.z = -1.0;

struct point p2 = {19, 25, -1}
struct point p3 = {.x=19, .z=1.0} //designated initializer, y is initalized to 0

//can pass by value and return by value
struct point add( struct point p1, struct point p2 ) {
	...
}
```

#### Type Names

create a user type 

```c
typedef struct {
	double x;
	double y;
	double z;
} point_t //add '_t' for user type

point_t add( point_t p1, point_t p2 ) {
	...
}
```

### Memory Allocation, De-allocation, Pointer

- three type of memory:

  - global variables
  - stack 
  - heap 

- data segment: 

  - global and static variables
    - default to 0 if not initialized

- global variable

  - variables declared outside of any function

- stack: 

  - local variables to functions
  - limit amount 

  ```c
  void foo(){
    //bar means: beyond recognition (joke)
  	int bar; //stack, lifetime is limited by the scope
    // need to initialize value for stack variable
  }
  ```

- heap:

  - dynamically allocated data
- large amount
  - sizeof() will give the correct size for a structure
  
  ```c
  void example(){
    // size will depends on your compiler, processor
  	int *x = malloc(sizeof(int))  //sizeof operator return # bytes storage; malloc return void *
  	
    // int* x, y => x is an int point, y is an int
    
      *x = 1; // deference operator
    	free(x); // return block of memory
    	x=NULL 
  }
  ```

#### Addess-of

- &: address of operator, tell the address of the variable
- *: deferencing operator 

```c
int work (int *x, int *y){
	return *x+*y;
}

void bar(){
	int a=2, b=4;
	int c = work(&a, &b) //& address pointer
}
```

####  The Arrow

```c
point_t *p4 = malloc(sizeof(point_t))
(*p4).x = 99.9  // operator precedence: . has a higher order precedence than *
//or 
p4->x = 99.9 // arrow operator
```

### Valgrind

Valgrind is the gateway to Valhalla; a gate that only the worthy can pass.

The purpose of memcheck is to look into all memory reads, writes, and to intercept and analyze every call to malloc/free and new/delete.

- Accessing uninitialized memory
- Reading off the end of an array
- Memory leaks (failing to free allocated memory)
- Incorrect freeing of memory (double free calls or a mismatch)
- Incorrect use of C standard functions like memcpy
- Using memory after it’s been freed.
- Asking for an invalid number of bytes in an allocation (negative?!)

#### How to run

```bash
 valgrind --leak-check=full myprog arg1 arg2
```

#### No error

```bash
==8476== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
```

#### error meaning

- **Definitely lost**: a clear memory leak. Fix it.
- **Indirectly lost**: a problem with a pointer based structure (e.g., you’ve lost the head of the linked list, but the rest of the list is indirectly lost.) Generally, fixing the definitely lost items should be enough to clear up the indirectly lost stuff.
- **Possibly lost**: the program is leaking memory unless weird things are going on with pointers where you’re pointing them to the middle of an allocated block.
- **Still reachable**: this is memory that was still allocated that might otherwise have been freed, but references to it exist so it at least wasn’t lost.
- **Suppressed**: you can configure the tool to ignore things and those will appear in the suppressed category.

### Helgrind

Helgrind is the gateway to, well, Hel.

The purpose of Helgrind is to detect errors in the use of POSIX pthreads.

Helgrind classifies errors into three basic categories:

1. Misuses of the pthreads API;
   1. Unlocking a mutex that is unlocked;
   2. Deallocation of memory with a locked mutex in it; or
   3. Thread exit while holding a lock.
2. Lock ordering problems; and

   2. we get deadlock because thread P holds mutex a and thread Q holds mutex b and each waits for the mutex that the other one has.
3. Data races.
   1. might have some false error 
   2. e.g. printf
