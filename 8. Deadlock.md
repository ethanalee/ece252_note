# Deadlock 

### The Dining Philosophers Problem

Five philosophers share a table, each having his or her own chair. In the centre of the table is a bowl of rice, and the table is laid with five single chopsticks. When a philosopher wishes to eat, she sits down at her designated chair, and attempts to pick up the two chopsticks that are nearest (one on the left, and one on the right). Philosophers are polite and therefore do not grab a chopstick out of the hands of a colleague. When a philosopher has both chopsticks, she may eat rice, and when she is finished, she puts down the chopsticks and goes back to thinking.

#### Case 1 - ideal case:

As a philosopher needs the chopstick to his left and right to eat, when the philosopher sits down he attempts to acquire the left chopstick, then the right, eats, and puts the chopsticks down. 

#### Case 2 - Deadlock and starvation:

All philosophers sit down at the same time. Each grabs the chopstick to his or her left. None of them are able to acquire the chopstick to his or her right (because someone has already picked it up). None of the philosophers can eat; they are all stuck.

This example makes it more clear why we call a situation where a thread never gets to run “starvation”. If a philosopher is never able to get both chopsticks, that philosopher will never be able to eat.

#### Case 3 - Protect the table with a binary semaphore:

This would allow exactly one philosopher at a time to eat, but at the very least, deadlock and starvation would be avoided. Although this works, it is a suboptimal solution.

#### Case 4 - The pigeonhole principle

What if we limit the number of philosophers at the table concurrently to four? 

**The pigeonhole principle**: if there are k pigeonholes and more than k pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must have at least two pigeons. 

Thus, at least one of the four philosophers can get two chopsticks [HZMG15]. Implementing the solution is easy; we have a general semaphore with a maximum and initial value of 4.

#### Case 5 - ordering:

Another idea: the problem above occurs because every philosopher tries to pick up the left chopstick first. If some of them try to pick up the left and some pick up the right first, then deadlock will not happen, either [SGG13].

### Deadlock

**Deadlock**: the *<u>permanent</u>* blocking of a set of processes that either compete for system resources or communicate with each other. 

If all process are stuck temporarily because one is waiting for some event, but this situation will resolve itself and is not deadlock.

A deadlock involves some conflicting needs for resources by two or more processes. 

### Resource

resource can be classified as either <u>reusable</u> or <u>conusmable</u> 

##### Reusable resource

A reusable resource can be used by one process at a time, and is not depleted by that use. A process may lock the resource, make use of it, then release it such that other processes may acquire it. 

Processors, memory, files, and semaphores are all examples of reusable resources. 

##### Consumable Resource

A consumable resource is one that is created and destroyed upon consumption. 

If the user presses the “Z” key on the keyboard, this generates an interrupt and produces the “Z” character in a buffer. A process that takes input will then consume that character (e.g., it goes into the vi editor window) and it is unavailable to other processes. Other things that are consumable resources: interrupts, posts, and messages. 

Deadlock is somewhat less likely when dealing with consumable resources, but in theory, all processes could be waiting to receive a message, if it is a blocking receive, and no process can send a message (because they are all waiting for some other process to send first).

### Conditions for Deadlock 

If the first three conditions are true, deadlock is possible, but deadlock will only happen if the fourth condition is fulfilled. 

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: A resource belongs to, at most, one process at a time.
2. **Hold-and-Wait**: A process that is currently holding some resources may request additional resources and may be forced to wait for them.
3. **No Preemption**: A resource cannot be “taken” from the process that holds it; only the process currently holding that resource may release it.
4. **Circular-Wait**: A cycle in the resource allocation graph.

### Dealing with Deadlock

There are four basic approaches to dealing with deadlock, each of which we will examine in turn.

1. Ignore it.
2. Deadlock prevention. 
3. Deadlock avoidance.
4. Deadlock detection.

#### Deadlock Option 1: Ignore it

pretend that deadlock can never happen, or if it does happen, it is someone else’s fault.

#### Deadlock Option 2: Deadlock Prevention

1. mutual exclusion (NO): The purpose of mutual exclusion is to prevent errors like inconsistent state or crashes.

2. hold and wait(Yes): we must guarantee that when a process requests a resource, it does not have any other resource.
   1. Another idea that might work is *two-phase locking*. A process attempts to lock a group of resources at once, and if it does not get everything it needs, it releases the locks it received and tries again. Thus a process does not wait while holding resources. If a philosopher picks up a chopstick but is unable to acquire a second, she puts down the chopstick she has picked up and tries again. Although she may not be the one to eat next, at least not all philosophers are stuck holding one chopstick.

3. No Preemption: 
   1. preemption: forcible removal of resources from a process, by the operating system.
