# File Systems 

This is a summary for Lecture 2 (interrupt) and Lecture 3 File system

[TOC]

## Interrupt

### Trap

Operating systems run on the basis of interrupts.

- the interrupts generated by hardware and devices 
- interrupts generated in software. 

A **trap (an exception)** is a software-generated interrupt.

- generated either by an error like an invalid instruction
- generated from a user program request.

### Invoking System Call

1. The user program pushes arguments onto the stack.
2. The user program invokes the system call.
3. The system call puts its identifier in the designated location.
4. The system call issues the trap instruction.
5. The OS responds to the interrupt and examines the identifier in the designated location.
6. The OS runs the system call handler that matches the identifier.
7. When the handler is finished, control exits the kernel and goes back to the system call (in user mode). 8. The system call returns control to the user program.

## File System

“Everything is a file!”

### File

1. **Name**: The symbolic file name, in human-readable form.
2. **Identifier**: The unique identifier, usually a number, that identifies the file inside the file system.
3. **Type**: Information about what kind of file it is.
4. **Location**: The physical location of the file, including what device (e.g., hard drive) it is on.
5. **Size**: The current, and possibly maximum, size of the file.
6. **Protection**: Access-control information, including who owns the file, who may read, write, and execute it...
7. **Time, Date, User ID**: The owner of the file, time of creation, last access, last change... any sort of data that is useful for protection, security, usage monitoring...

### File Open & Close

#### fopen()

```c
FILE* fopen( const char* filename, const char* mode );
```

#### fclose()

```c
int fclose ( FILE* stream );
```

#### Open Call Mode

- **r**: Open the file for reading only.
- **w**: Open the file for writing. If a file with the name exists, it’s overwritten.
- **a**: Open the file, appending data at the end of the file.
- **r+**: Open for read and update (the file must exist).
- **w+**: Create a file and open it for update; if the file exists it’s overwritten.
- **a+**: Open a file for update, with new output operations at the end of the file.

with combination of `b` for binary

with combination of `x` for making any write operation fail if the file exists

##### Example

```c
FILE* f = fopen( argv[1], "r"); 
if ( f == NULL ) {
	printf("Unable to open file! %s is invalid name?\n", argv[1] );
	return -1; 
}
fclose( f );
```

### File Repositioning

```c
int fseek ( FILE* stream, long int offset, int origin );
```

This adjusts the pointer for reading or writing. This should be done with caution though, because you can go to an arbitrary location, even the middle of a two (or more) byte character. And we can’t seek when a file is opened for append.

### File Deletion

```c
int remove ( const char * filename );
```

### File Lock

In UNIX if a file is open in a program, another user can still delete the file and it will be removed from the directory. As long as that program remains open and retains that reference to the file, it can still operate on that file. However, once the file is no longer open in a program, its storage space will be marked as free.

#### fileno()

```c
int fileno(FILE *stream);
```

- argument: 
  - **stream**: file pointer
- return:
  - **int**: a file descriptor

#### flock()

```c
int flock(int fd, int operation);
```

- argument:
  - **fd**: a file descriptor for the file to be locked
  - **operation**: type of lock
    - **LOCK_EX**: exclusive lock - other processes cannot open the file or delete the file
    - **LOCK_SH**: shared lock
    - **LOCK_UN**: unlock

##### example

```c
FILE* f = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
int file_desc = fileno( f );
int result = flock( file_desc, LOCK_EX );
```

### File Write

#### fprintf() & fwrite()

```c
int fprintf ( FILE * stream, const char * format, ... );
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
```

##### Example

```c
void write_points_to_file( point* p, FILE f ) { 
  while( p != NULL ) {
    fprintf(f, "(%d, %d, %d)\n", p->x, p->y, p->z);
		p = p->next; 
  }
}
```

### File Read

#### fscanf() & getline() & fread()

```c
int fscanf ( FILE * stream, const char * format, ... );
ssize_t getline(char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream);
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
```

##### example

```c
int main( int argc, char** argv ){ 
  FILE *fp;
	int i, isquared;
	fp = fopen("results.dat", "r"); 
  if (fp == NULL) {
		return -1; 
  }
	while (fscanf(fp, "%d,%d\n", &i, &isquared) == 2) { 
    	printf("i: %d, isquared: %d\n", i, isquared);
	}
	fclose(fp);
	return 0; 
}
```

#### read()

```c
ssize_t read (int file_descriptor , void *buffer , size_t count)
```

- argument:
  - **file_descriptor**: the file 
  - **buffer**: where to read the data to
  - **count**: number of bytes to read.

- return:
  - **int**: bytesRead

##### example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
    
void readfile( int fd );
int main( int argc, char** argv ) { 
	// check argument
	if ( argc != 2 ) {
		printf("Usage: %s <filename >\n" , argv[0]);
		return -1; 
  }
  // open file 
	int fd = open( argv[1] , O_RDONLY ); 
	if ( fd == -1 ) {
		printf("Unable to open file ! %s is invalid name?\n", argv[1] );
		return -1; 
  }
  // read file 
	readfile( fd ); 
  close( fd ); 
  return -1;
}
void readfile( int fd ) {
  int buf_size = 256;
  char* buffer = malloc( buf_size ); 
  while ( 1 ) {
  	memset ( buffer , 0 , buf_size ) ;
  	int bytes_read = read( fd, buffer, buf_size -1 ); 
    if ( bytes_read == 0 ) {
  		break ; 
    }
  printf("%s", buffer); }
  printf("\nEnd of File.\n");
	free( buffer ); 
}
```

### File permission

#### Permission Bit

The permissions are represented using 10 bits:

- 1:  the directory bit 
- 2-3-4: the read, write, and execute bits for the owner
- 5-6-7: the read, write, and execute bits for the group
- 8-9-10: the read, write, and execute bits for everyone

Precedence goes from left to right: owner takes precedence over the group; group takes precedence over the permissions for everyone.

#### Type of Permission

1. Read
2. Write
3. Execute
4. Append (write at the end of the file)
5. Delete
6. List (view the attributes of the file)

## Concurrency in File Systems

### file structure

#### contiguous allocation 

a file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on disk. So a file is allocated, starting at block b and is n blocks in size, the file takes up blocks b,b+1,b+2,...,b+(n−1). But for a sufficiently large file, it might be difficult to find a place to put it. And we also don’t know how to predict the size of a file, so how much space do we leave for where to put it?

#### Linked allocation

instead of a file being all in consecutive blocks, we maintain a linked list of the blocks, and the blocks themselves may be located anywhere on the disk. The directory listing just has a pointer to the first and last blocks (head and tail of the linked list). Unfortunately, however, accessing block i of a file is no longer as simple as computing an offset from the first block; it requires following i pointers (a pain). If we want to go to the middle of a file, why do we have to load every block on the way there?

#### indexed allocation

The idea of indexed allocation is to take all the pointers and put them into one location: an index block. So, the first block of the file contains a whole bunch of pointers. To get to block i, just go to index i of the index block and we can get the location of block i much more efficiently than we could in linked allocation. All pointers to blocks start as null, and when we add a new block, add its corresponding entry into the index block [SGG13]. 

### File Lock: record locking

**record locking**: lock only a part of a file, specifically a byte range of that file

#### struct flock 

read locks are compatible with other read locks; write locks are not compatible with any other lock.

```c
struct flock {
	short l_type; /* F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, or F_UNLCK */
	short l_whence; /* SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END */
	off_t l_start; /* offset in bytes, relative to l_whence */ 
  off_t l_len; /* length, in bytes; 0 means lock to EOF */ 
  pid_t l_pid; /* returned with F_GETLK */
};
```

#### fcntl()

if a process is writing the beginning of the file, another one can be writing the end of the file and these don’t overlap so the second write does not need to wait.

```c
#include fcntl.h
int fcntl( int file_descriptor, int command, ... /* struct flock * flockptr */ )

```

- argument:
  - file_descriptor: a fd
  - command:
    - **F_GETLK** – Determine if the lock described by `flockptr` is blocked by some other lock. If a lock exists, the content of `flockptr` is overwritten with the data of the lock; if no lock exists then the `l_type` field is set to `F_UNLCK`.
    - **F_SETLK** – Set the lock as described by `flockptr`. If the lock cannot be acquired then the return value of the function returns an error and errno are set. This is “trylock”-behaviour and can be used to avoid the possibility of a deadlock.
    - **F_SETLKW** – A blocking version of the `F_SETLK` command. If the region we want to lock is currently in use then the caller gets blocked.

#### example: lock and unlock

```c
int write_lock_file( int fd ) {
	struct flock fl; 
  fl.l_type = F_WRLOCK; 
  fl.l_start = 0; 
  fl.l_whence = SEEK_SET; 
  fl.l_len = 0;
	return fcntl( fd, F_SETLK, &fl ); 
}

int unlock_file( int fd ) {
	struct flock fl; 
  fl.l_type = F_UNLCK; 
  fl.l_start = 0; 
  fl.l_whence = SEEK_SET; 
  fl.l_len = 0;
	return fcntl( fd, F_SETLK, &fl ); 
}
```

#### example: check if locked 

```c
int fd = open ( "example.txt", O_RDONLY ); 

struct flock lock;
lock.l_type = F_RDLOCK;
lock.l_start = 1024;
lock.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
lock.l_len = 256;
fcntl( fd, F_GETLK, &lock );

if ( lock.l_type == F_UNLCK ) {
  /* Lock is unlocked; we may proceed */
} else if ( lock.l_type = F_WRLOCK ) {
	/* File is write locked by a different process */ 
  printf( "File locked by process ID %d.\n", lock.l_pid ); 
  return -1;
}
```

#### lockf()

it is a simplified way of locking a file. While fcntl is more flexible, sometimes all we need is the simple version. 

The file is automatically unlocked when the file descriptor is closed.

```c
int lockf( int file_descriptor, int command, off_t length );
```

- argument:
  - file_descriptor: a fd
  - command:
    - **F_LOCK** – Acquire an exclusive lock on the (section of the) file.
    - **F_TLOCK** – Try to acquire an exclusive lock (try-lock behaviour).
    - **F_ULOCK** – Unlock the indicated section of the file.
    - **F_TEST** – Check if (a section of) the file is locked; 0 if it is unlocked and -1 if the file is locked.
  - length: 
    - an offset, and is based off the current position in the file
    - If zero is provided then it locks the whole file.

### Using A File as a Lock

We can use the very existence of a file as a way of controlling concurrency.

check if the file is present; if it is, the resource is “locked”, if no such file is present then it is “unlocked”.

```c
int open(const char *filename, int flags); /* Returns a file descriptor if successful, -1 on error */
int rename(const char *old_filename, const char *new_filename); /* Returns 0 on success , operates atomically */ 
int remove(const char *filename) ; /* Deletes a file or directory, returns 0 on success, operates atomically */
```

If we want we can use remove to delete the lock file if we want to let the next process try, but there’s an alternative option: rename.

Because the rename function is also atomic, we can use it too, and just rename the existing lock file rather than creating it and deleting it every time. Then programs that want their turn should use rename; if a process or thread does succeed in renaming the file it is that process or thread’s turn; otherwise, they have to wait. To unlock, just change the name back.

| **Value** | **Meaning**                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| O_RDONLY  | Open the file read-only                                      |
| O_WDONLY  | Open the file write-only                                     |
| O_RDWR    | Open the file for both reading and writing                   |
| O_APPEND  | Append information to the end of the file                    |
| O_TRUNC   | Initially clear all data from the file                       |
| O_CREAT   | Create the file                                              |
| O_EXCL    | If used with O_CREAT, the caller MUST create the file; if the file exists it will fail |

#### example: lock file 

```c

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <fcntl.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <sys/stat.h> 
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <pthread.h>
#define NUM_THREADS 10 int lock_fd;

int shared = 0;
void* run( void* arg ) {
	int* id = (int*) arg;
	while( rename( "file.lock", "file.locked" ) == -1 ) {
    printf("Thread %d waiting.\n", *id);
  }
	printf("Thread %d in critical section.\n", *id); 
  printf("Shared incremented from %d", shared); 
  shared++;
	printf(" to %d.\n", shared); 
  rename("file.locked", "file.lock"); /* Unlock */
	free( arg );
  pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void* writer( void* arg ) {
	/* Write data implementation not shown */ 
  pthread_exit(NULL);
}
int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
	lock_fd = open( "file.lock", O_CREAT | O_EXCL ); 
  if (lock_fd == -1 ) {
   	printf( "File creation failed.\n");
		return -1; 
  }
	pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
		int * id = malloc( sizeof( int ) );
		*id = i;
		pthread_create( &threads[i], NULL, run, id );
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) { 
    pthread_join( threads[i], NULL );
  }
  close( lock_fd );
  remove( "file.lock" );
	return 0; 
}
```



## Directory

1. **Search**. We want to be able to find a file, and searching is typically not just on the file name but may include the contents of files as well, if their content is human-readable data.
2. **Add a File**. Add a file to the directory.
3. **Remove a File**. Remove a file from the directory.
4. **List a Directory**. List the files of the directory and the contents of the directory entry.
5. **Rename a File**. Change the user-friendly file name, possibly changing the file’s position in the directory if it is sorted by name.
6. **Navigate the File System**. It should be possible to open subdirectories, go to parent directories, and so on.

**Link**: a pointer to another file.

**hardlinks**: creating a second pointer to the underlying file in the file system. If a hardlink exists and the user deletes that file, the file still remains on disk until the last hardlink is removed. 

**symlinks (symbolic link)**: a “shortcut” to a file and referenced by file name
