# Network and Socket

This summary covers material from Lecture 7(), Lecture 8(), and Lecture 9 (Inclass 1)

If two processes are not running on the same machine in the same environment, then to get them to communicate, we must communicate over the network. 

[TOC]

## Socket

The socket is the concept for how to establish a communication channel between two processes. 

There are really two ways that we can communicate: datagrams and connection streams.

- datagrams: 
  - like sending a letter in the mail
  - There’s no “connection” to be established.
  - send a message addressed to the socket being used by the peer process.
- connection streams
  - like making a telephone call
  - a line of communication is established to allow exchange of data (talking)

need to include library in header file

```c
# include <sys/socket.h>
```

### Open/Close a Socket

#### open()

call the socket to create a socket, which is handled like a file 

```c
int socket( int domain, int type, int protocol );
```

- argument:
  - **domain**: defines the address format (IPv4 vs IPv6), we will use IPv4
    - `AF_INET`: IPv4 Internet domain
  - **type**: what kind of information we are going to be sending; 
    - `SOCK_DGRAM` : fixed-length, datagram
    - `SOCK_STREAM` : bidirectional, connection-oriented byte streams
      - when we read data from a SOCK_STREAM socket, it might not return the same number of bytes written by the sender. 
      - We will eventually get everything sent to us, but it might take several function calls.
  - **protocol**: how data is transported over the connection; 
    - `0`:  for default 
    - if the type is `SOCK_STREAM` in `AF_INET`: defualt is TCP/IP (reliable)
    - if the type is `SOCK_DGRAM` in `AF_INET`: defualt is UDP (not reliable)
- Return: 
  - **int**: file descriptor is really just an integer
    - `-1`: error

#### close()

If you open a socket, you need to close it 

```c
int close(int sockfd);
```

### Mind your Endian

![image-20191214040309792](/Users/shuyi/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20191214040309792.png)

- x86 architecture uses little-endian,
- others (PowerPC) use big-endian
- network protocols uses big-endian format

```c
#include <arpa/inet.h>

uint32_t htonl( uint32_t hostint32 ); /* Translate 4 byte int to network format */ 
uint16_t htons( uint16_t hostint16 ); /* Translate 2 byte int to network format */ 
uint32_t ntohl( uint32_t netint32 ); /* Translate 4 byte int to host format */ 
uint16_t ntohs( uint16_t netint16 ); /* Translate 2 byte int to host format */

// s for short;
// l for long
// h for host
// n for network
```

### Addressing

#### struct sockaddr_in + struct in_addr

structures which holds the information of an address

```c
#include <netinet/in.h>
struct sockaddr_in {
	sa_family_t 		sin_family; 	/* Address family */ 
  in_port_t 			sin_port; 		/* Port number: uint16_t */
	struct in_addr 	sin_addr; 		/* IPv4 Address */
};

struct in_addr {
  in_addr_t       s_addr;				/* IPv4 address: uint32_t */
};
```

- argument
  - **sin_family**: family type, we use `AF_INET`
  - sin_port: port number
    - Different services (processes) are communicating over different ports. 
  - **sin_addr.s_addr**: address
    - **INADDR_ANY**: choose the current IP address of the current computer

##### example: initialization

```c
struct sockaddr_in addr;
addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
addr.sin_port = htons( 2520 ); 
addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl( INADDR_ANY ); //choose the current IP address of the current computer
```

#### getaddrinfo() + freeaddrinfo() + struct addrinfo

```c
int getaddrinfo(
	const char 	*node, 						// e.g. "www.example.com" or IP 
	const char 	*service, 				// e.g. "http" or port number
	const struct addrinfo *hints, 
	struct addrinfo **res
);

void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *ai);

struct addrinfo {
  int               ai_flags;				/* custom behaviour*/ 
  int               ai_family;			/* address family*/ 
  int               ai_socktype;		/* socket type*/ 
  int               ai_protocol;		/* protocol */ 
  socklen_t         ai_addrlen;			/* length of bytes of address*/ 
  struct sockaddr  *ai_addr;			 	/* address*/ 
  char             *ai_canonname;  	/* canonical name of host */
  struct addrinfo  *ai_next;       	/* next in list */
  //...
};
```

- argument:
  - **node**: hostname or IP address.
    - e.g. `www.example.com` or IP address
  - **service**: protocol or port number
    - e.g. use 80 for HTTP
  - **hints**: used (optionally) to restrict the kind of connection you want.
    - you want IPv4, TCP Stream sockets, and letting the function fill in the IP address (see example below)
  - **res**: pointer to structure which will be updated with the result when the function is done
- return
  - 0: OK, 
  - nonzero: error code on error

##### example: initialization

```c
struct addrinfo hints ;
struct addrinfo *res; // pointer to the results

memset(&hints , 0, sizeof hints );// make sure the struct is empty
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;			// fill in my IP for me
hints.ai_family = AF_INET ; 			// Choose IPv4
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM ;	// TCP stream sockets

// store the result in serverinfo
int result = getaddrinfo ( "www.example.com" , "2520" , &hints , &res);
if (result != 0) {
	return −1; 
}

struct sockaddr_in * sock_ain = (struct sockaddr_in*) res−>ai_addr; 
freeaddrinfo ( res ) ;
```

If we are interested in getting the structure for the localcomputer, we can manually initialize the `struct sockaddr_in` as we did before learning about how `getaddrinfo()` works. Or we can call `getaddrinfo()` with `NULL` as thenode parameter.

### Client: connection

#### connect()

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int connect( int sockfd , struct sockaddr *addr , socklen_t len );
```

- argument:
  - **sockfd**: socket file descriptor (the int we got back from the call to `socket()`)
  - **addr**: a pointer to address structure
    - manually created
    - get from `getaddrinfo()`, use `res−>ai_addr`
  - **len**: size of addr
    - manually created: Use  `sizeof` 
    - get from `getaddrinfo()`: use `res−>ai_addrlen`
- return
  - 0: success 
  - anything else: error

#### example for client: use getaddrinfo()

```c
// get address information
struct addrinfo hints ; 
struct addrinfo *res ; 
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof( hints )); 
hints.ai_family = AF_INET ;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM ;
getaddrinfo ( "www.uwaterloo.ca " , "80" ,&hints , &res);

// open a socket
int sockfd;
sockfd = socket ( res−>ai_family , res−>ai_socktype , res−>ai_protocol ) ;

// connect
int status = connect ( sockfd , res−>ai_addr , res−>ai_addrlen ) ;
```

### Server: Binding, listen, accept

#### bind()

associate the socket with whatever port we want to use

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t len);
```

- argument (same as `connect()`):
  - **sockfd**: socket file descriptor (the int we got back from the call to `socket()`)
  - **addr**: a pointer to address structure
    - manually created
    - get from `getaddrinfo()`, use `res−>ai_addr`
  - **len**: size of addr
    - manually created: Use  `sizeof` 
    - get from `getaddrinfo()`: use `res−>ai_addrlen`
- return
  - 0: success 
  - anything else: error

#### listen()

int this step we wait for incoming connections.

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int listen( int sockfd , int backlog );
```

- argument (same as `connect()`):
  - **sockfd**: socket file descriptor (the int we got back from the call to `socket()`)
  - **backlog**: backlog connections when we are listen to an socket which is bound with `bind()`
    - usually is limited to 20 or so, it depends on your system
    - If the queue is full the server system will reject additional requests.
- return
  - 0:  success 
  - -1: error

#### accept()

accept incoming connect requests, so we can start talking.

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int accept( int sockfd , struct sockaddr *addr , socklen_t *len );
```

- argument:
  - **sockfd**: socket file descriptor for the socket we are listen to
  - **addr**: a pointer to address structure of <u>client</u>
    - `NULL`: if not care
  - **len**: a pointer to size of addr of <u>client</u>
    - `NULL`: if not care
- return
  - int: a new file descriptor which describes a new socket.
    - Further communication takes places over that socket (and not the original one). 
    - The original socket is still used for accepting connections, and the new one is the socket used for communication with the client. 

If `accept()` is called and no requests are in the queue, the server is blocked until a request arrives. We simply wait for the connection.

#### Example for Server: manually fill  sockaddr_in + care about client

```c
struct sockaddr_in client_addr ;
int client_addr_size = sizeof( struct sockaddr_in ); 
int newsockfd ;

// open a socket
int socketfd = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// manually filled up information for bind()
struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_port = htons ( 2520 ); 
server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl (INADDR_ANY);

// bind()
bind(socketfd, (struct sockaddr*) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));

// listen()
listen( socketfd , 5 );

// accept()
newsockfd = accept(socktfd, (struct sockaddr*) &client_adr, &client_addr_size);

close ( newsockfd ) ;
close ( socketfd ) ;
```

#### Example for Server: manually fill  sockaddr_in + does not care about client

```c
int newsockfd ;

// open a socket
int socketfd = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// fill address infor
struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_port = htons ( 2520 ); 
server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl (INADDR_ANY);

// bind()
bind( socketfd , ( struct sockaddr*) &server_addr , sizeof (server_addr));
// listen()
listen( socketfd , 5 );
// accept()
newsockfd = accept ( socktfd , NULL, NULL) ;

close ( newsockfd ) ;
close ( socketfd ) ;
```

## Data Transfering

### Send

#### send()

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int send( int sockfd, const void* msg, int length, int flags );
```

- argument:
  - **sockfd**: Socket to send the data to.
    - client- side: returned by `socket()` 
    - server-side: returned by `accept()` 
  - **msg**: a pointer to data which will be sent.
  - **length**: size of the message to be send.
  - **flags**: Options; we will use 0
- Returns: 
  - int: number of bytes sent if OK, 
  - −1: error and errno
  - ideal: the number of bytes sent equals the length parameter
  - Otherwise – not all data was sent! <u>send multiple times</u>

#### Example (ideal)

```c
char *msg = "Hello world !"
int len = strnlen( msg, 13 );
int sent = send( sockfd, msg, len, 0 );
```

#### Example (real life)

Track the number of bytes sent and keep calling send, updating the pointer as you advance:

```c
int sendall( int socket, char *buf, int *len ) {
	int total_send = 0; 				// how many bytes we’ve sent
	int bytesleft = *len; // how many we have left to send int n;
	while( total < *len ) {
		n = send( socket, buf + total_send, bytesleft, 0 ); 
    if (n == -1) {
			break; 
    }
    total_send += n;
    bytesleft -= n;
	}
  *len = total_send; 				// return number actually sent here
  return n == -1 ? -1 : 0; // return -1 on failure, 0 on success 
}
```

### Receive

#### recv()

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
int recv( int sockfd , void * buffer , int length , int flags );
```

- argument:
  - **sockfd**: socket descriptor - the place to receive data from
  - **buffer**: the destination where the data goes
  - **length**: the maximum size of that buffer
  - **flags**: flags can also be 0 here.
- Return value: 
  - int: the number of bytes actually read into the buffer;  
  - −1:  on error
  - 0: the other side hung up on you: they closed the socket

### Datagram

#### sendto() + recvfrom()

```c
int sendto( int sockfd, const void* msg, int length, unsigned int flags, const struct sockaddr* to, socklen_t tolength );

int recvfrom( int sockfd, void* buffer, int length, unsigned int flags, struct sockaddr* from, int* fromlength );

```

there’s no connection established, each send has parameters for where to send the data to and each receive tells you where the data is being received from. 

Send still returns the number of bytes sent and may be less than you were expecting if sending a large amount of data.

If you call connect() on a datagram socket, incidentally, 

- you can then skip some of this and just use the regularsend and recv operations
- the transport is still UDP, but the source and destination don’t need to be added every time.

## cURL

### cURL

- a network communication and transfer request library.
- only for the client-side and isn’t meant to be used for server-side operations.
- The curl library can do a lot of things and communicate via a lot of different protocols
- https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/

#### curl_global_init() + curl_global_cleanup()

- This function sets up the program environment that libcurl needs.
- This function must be called at least once within a program before the program calls any other function in libcurl.
- <u>not thread safe</u>

```c
CURLcode curl_global_init(long flags);
void curl_global_cleanup(void);
```

- argument:
  - flags: enough with `CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT`

#### curl_easy_init() + curl_easy_cleanup()

```c
CURL *curl_easy_init();
void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *handle);
```

- return
  - an CURL easy handle 
  - `NULL`: If something goes wrong

- If you did not already call [curl_global_init](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_global_init.html), [curl_easy_init](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_init.html) does it automatically. 
- Each connection is accessed through the handle
- a handle is something that you must use as input to other functions in the easy interface.

#### curl_easy_perform()

```c
CURLcode curl_easy_perform(CURL *easy_handle);
```

- return:
  - CURLcode: the struct for finding out how openration went 
    - `CURLE_OK`: the response code if all went well
- [curl_easy_perform](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_perform.html) performs the entire request in a blocking manner and returns when done, or if it failed. 
- For non-blocking behavior, see [curl_multi_perform](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_multi_perform.html).

#### curl_easy_reset()

```c
void curl_easy_reset(CURL *handle);
```

- Re-initializes all options previously set on a specified CURL handle to the default values. 

- This puts back the handle to the same state as it was in when it was just created with [curl_easy_init](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_init.html).

- Allows you to reuse a handle

  

#### Example: simple curl 

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main( int argc, char** argv ) { 
  CURL *curl ;
  CURLcode res ;

  curl_global_init ( CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT );
  
  curl = curl_easy_init (); 
  if( curl ) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/" ); 
    res = curl_easy_perform ( curl ) ;
    if( res != CURLE_OK) {
      fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));
    }
    curl_easy_cleanup ( curl ) ; 
  }
  
  curl_global_cleanup () ;
  return 0; 
}
```

### Callback

we want to do something useful with the data we got. Or, we might have some data that we need to send. 

#### Read callback

The read callback is used when you are uploading data to the server (sometimes this is a POST operation). 

```c
size_t read_callback( char *buffer, size_t size, size_t nitems, void *inputdata );
```

- The name of the function can be anything you like. 
- argument:
  - **buffer**: the area where you are going to put the data to send (and it can’t be any bigger than the next parameters specify). 
  - **size**: the size of each data element
  - **nitems**: the number of items. 
    - In practice you will just want to calculate the maximum buffer size by multiplying these two things together. 
- return value: 
  - size_t: the number of bytes successfully put there. 
  - 0, it signals end-of-file and means no further upload will take place.

#### Write Callback

The write callback is used when you are receiving data from the server (this can be a GET operation). 

```c
size_t write_callback( char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata );
```

- The name of the function can be anything you like. 
- argument:
  - **ptr**: pointer to whatever data we received
  - **size**: represents a size
  - **nmemb**: the size of that data. 
    - size is always 1 (the documentation does not explain why this is the case). 
  - **userdata**: we can pass some data to the processing function directly.
    - If, for example, we want to write the requested data to a file with a specified name, we can pass that name in the userdata pointer, and then our implementation of the write callback should know how to use it. 
- return: 
  - size_t: number of bytes processed.
  - The spec requires that the returned size is the number of bytes of the data successfully processed.
  - If it’s not equal to the size of nmemb then the library interprets that as an error in writing.

#### Register Callback

To register the read and write callback respectively, there are two steps.

One to register the function, and another to set the data

```c
CURLcode curl_easy_setopt( CURL *handle, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_callback ); 
CURLcode curl_easy_setopt( CURL *handle, CURLOPT_READDATA, void *pointer );

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt( CURL *handle, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_callback ); 
CURLcode curl_easy_setopt( CURL *handle, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, void *pointer );
```

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <curl/curl.h>

const char data[]="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing " "elit. Sed vel urna neque. Ut quis leo metus. Quisque eleifend, ex at " "laoreet rhoncus, odio ipsum semper metus, at tempus ante urna in mauris. " "Suspendisse ornare tempor venenatis. Ut dui neque, pellentesque a varius " "eget, mattis vitae ligula. Fusce ut pharetra est. Ut ullamcorper mi ac " "sollicitudin semper. Praesent sit amet tellus varius, posuere nulla non, " "rhoncus ipsum.";

struct data {
	char *readptr; 
  size_t sizeleft;
};


size_t read_callback( void *dest, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp ) { 
  struct data *d = (struct data *) userp;
	size_t buffer_size = size * nmemb;
	if( d->sizeleft > 0 ) {
		/* copy as much as possible from the source to the destination */ 
    size_t copy_this_much = d->sizeleft;
    if ( copy_this_much > buffer_size ) {
			copy_this_much = buffer_size;
		}
    memcpy(dest, d->readptr, copy_this_much);
		d->readptr += copy_this_much; 
    d->sizeleft -= copy_this_much; 
    return copy_this_much;
	}
	return 0; /* no more data left to deliver */ 
}

int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
  CURL *curl;
  CURLcode res;
	struct data * d = malloc( sizeof( struct data ) );
  
  d->readptr = data;
  d->sizeleft = strlen( data );
	
  res = curl_global_init( CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT ); 
  
  if ( res != CURLE_OK ) {
		fprintf( stderr, "curl_global_init() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror( res ) ); 
    return 1;
	}
	curl = curl_easy_init(); 
  if ( curl ) {
		curl_easy_setopt( curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/index.cgi" );
    /* Now specify we want to POST data */
    curl_easy_setopt( curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1L );
		curl_easy_setopt( curl, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_callback ); 
    curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_READDATA, d );
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    /* Check for errors */
    if(res != CURLE_OK) {
    	fprintf( stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror( res ) );
    }
    curl_easy_cleanup( curl );
  }
	free( d ); 
  curl_global_cleanup(); 
  return 0;
}
```
